# Project Brief
## AI Math Tutor - Socratic Learning Assistant

**Last Updated:** November 3, 2025  
**Status:** In Development  
**Timeline:** 3 Days (November 3-6, 2025)

---

## Project Overview

An AI-powered math tutoring application that uses the Socratic method to guide students through mathematical problems. Unlike traditional math solvers that show answers, this tutor asks guiding questions that help students discover solutions independently.

**Inspiration:** OpenAI x Khan Academy demo demonstrating effective AI-assisted learning through dialogue.

---

## Core Objectives

1. **Primary Goal:** Guide students through math problems without giving direct answers
2. **Conversational Context:** Maintain dialogue across multiple turns
3. **Adaptive Teaching:** Adjust approach based on student understanding level
4. **Multiple Input Methods:** Support text and image input for problems
5. **Clean Interface:** Intuitive, learning-focused user experience

---

## Target Users

- Students (grades 6-12) learning mathematics
- Self-learners seeking interactive problem-solving help
- Educators looking for supplementary tutoring tools

---

## Success Metrics

- Successfully guides students through 5+ different problem types
- Maintains coherent dialogue for 10+ conversation turns
- Achieves 90%+ accuracy in problem extraction from images
- Average session length of 5+ minutes (engagement indicator)

---

## Out of Scope

- Multi-user collaboration features
- Student progress tracking across sessions
- LMS integrations
- Automated grading/assessment
- Advanced mathematics (calculus, linear algebra)

---

## Project Constraints

- **Timeline:** 3 days development window
- **Hosting:** Vercel or Render (not Firebase Hosting)
- **Backend:** Firebase Cloud Functions for secure API calls
- **API Security:** OpenAI key must be server-side (Cloud Functions)

---

## Key Differentiator

**Natural conversational teaching** - The AI feels like a real tutor having a conversation, NOT a robotic quiz that asks repetitive questions. This is the #1 priority and accounts for 50% of evaluation criteria.
