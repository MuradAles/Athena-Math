## 📝 Notes

### Key Decisions Made
1. Using Firebase Cloud Functions for secure API calls (production deployment)
2. Hosting on Firebase Hosting (integrated with Firebase services)
3. OpenAI SDK direct (not LangChain)
4. **Smart model selection:** GPT-4o for images (vision), GPT-4o-mini for text-only
5. Natural conversation settings (temp: 0.8, penalties: 0.5/0.3)
6. Context window: last 8 messages only
7. **Images sent directly to AI:** No text extraction, images in OpenAI vision format
8. **Image display:** Images stored in Firestore with `imageUrl` field, displayed inline in messages
9. **Model switching deferred:** Focus on validation improvements first, switch model (GPT-5-mini or GPT-4o) LAST when finishing project
10. **Math tools validation:** Mandatory tool usage for ALL numerical answers, using nerdamer for accurate calculations
11. **Image message reconstruction:** Messages with images reconstructed to OpenAI vision format when reading from Firestore
12. **Whiteboard integration:** Ref-based communication between whiteboard and chat, canvas exported as PNG and sent to AI
13. **Real-time subscriptions:** Firestore real-time subscriptions for chat list updates (no polling)
14. **Celebration system:** Confetti and sparkle animations with debouncing to prevent duplicates
15. **Sidebar redesign:** ChatGPT-style collapsible sidebar with persistent chat access
16. **Streak system:** Changed from consecutive streak to daily solved count ("X solved today")

### Critical Reminders
- **Priority #1:** Natural conversational prompt (not robotic)
- **Priority #2:** Never give direct answers
- **Priority #3:** Mandatory validation - ALL numerical answers must be validated with tools
- **Priority #4:** Test extensively before moving forward
