## 🐛 Known Issues

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Import error: Created barrel export (`src/types/index.ts`) and used `import type` for type-only imports
- ✅ Unsupported API parameters: Removed frequency_penalty/presence_penalty for GPT-5, using gpt-4o/gpt-4o-mini
- ✅ Organization verification: Using gpt-4o-mini for text-only (no verification needed)
- ✅ Firebase Storage permissions: Deployed storage rules
- ✅ CORS errors: Fixed Cloud Function CORS handling
- ✅ Image extraction: Removed automatic extraction, images sent directly to AI
- ✅ Image display: Images now show in messages instead of URLs

**Fixed:**
- ✅ **Validation Issue:** Implemented mandatory math tool validation system
  - Added math tools with nerdamer for accurate calculations
  - Enhanced prompt with mandatory validation rules
  - Improved validation function with better numeric comparison
  - AI now MUST use tools to validate all numerical answers
- ✅ **Image message reconstruction:** Fixed issue where messages with images weren't converted back to OpenAI vision format when reading from Firestore

**Fixed:**
- ✅ **Auto-play audio not working:** Fixed React Hooks error (useCallback inside map), removed excessive console logs, reduced message spacing
- ✅ **React Hooks error:** Removed useCallback from inside map function, used inline function instead

## 📝 Notes

### Key Decisions Made
1. Using Firebase Cloud Functions for secure API calls (production deployment)
2. Hosting on Vercel/Render (not Firebase Hosting)
3. OpenAI SDK direct (not LangChain)
4. **Smart model selection:** GPT-4o for images (vision), GPT-4o-mini for text-only
5. Natural conversation settings (temp: 0.8, penalties: 0.5/0.3)
6. Context window: last 8 messages only
7. **Images sent directly to AI:** No text extraction, images in OpenAI vision format
8. **Image display:** Images stored in Firestore with `imageUrl` field, displayed inline in messages
9. **Model switching deferred:** Focus on validation improvements first, switch model (GPT-5-mini or GPT-4o) LAST when finishing project
10. **Math tools validation:** Mandatory tool usage for ALL numerical answers, using nerdamer for accurate calculations
11. **Image message reconstruction:** Messages with images reconstructed to OpenAI vision format when reading from Firestore
12. **Whiteboard integration:** Ref-based communication between whiteboard and chat, canvas exported as PNG and sent to AI

### Critical Reminders
- **Priority #1:** Natural conversational prompt (not robotic)
- **Priority #2:** Never give direct answers
- **Priority #3:** Mandatory validation - ALL numerical answers must be validated with tools
- **Priority #4:** Test extensively before moving forward

**Document Status:** Day 2 complete - Math tools validation system implemented, image message reconstruction fixed, whiteboard image upload and canvas-to-chat integration working. Ready for validation testing.
